# Neural Networks with Tensorflow Playground

This activity teaches an introduction to neural networks using the Scienxlab version of [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.scienxlab.org/).

It is in three parts

1. [**Lecture**](./src/content/neural-networks/playground/Lecture.md): A short lecture to introduce the activity
2. [**Neural Network Demo**](./src/content/neural-networks/playground/Demo.md): A demo that can either be done together or worked through individually or in groups
3. [**Practical Activity**](./src/content/neural-networks/playground/Practical.md): A set of questions/tasks for students to work through individually or in groups

After this, there is some further information about neural networks in the **Key Concepts** section; this explains some of the terms used in the Tensorflow Playground. Finally, there are some suggested **Extensions** that students can explore after the session.

The website is currently hosted at [neuralnetworkstensorflowplayground.netlify.app](https://neuralnetworkstensorflowplayground.netlify.app)

## Development

This activity is built into a website that uses [Slideberry](https://github.com/davidgundry/slideberry) for presenting slides, teaching activities and lecture notes.

This requires Node package manager to be installed. Install dependencies with

```bash
npm install
```

Start a development server on `localhost:8000`.

```bash
npm start
```
